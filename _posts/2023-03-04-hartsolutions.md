## Running the Project

To run the project on your local machine, make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine

   git clone https://github.com/HartJN/Hart-Solutions.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal/command prompt

   ```

3. Install the dependencies by running npm install

   ```bash

   ```

4. Run the development server using npm run dev

This will start a local development server that you can access at http://localhost:5173.

## Building and Previewing the Project

To build the project for production, run npm run build. This will compile the TypeScript code and generate a set of static files that can be deployed to a server.

```

To preview the built project, run npm run preview. This will start a local server that serves the built files, allowing you to see how the project will look when deployed.

```bash
